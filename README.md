## Interfere

Interfere is a desktop HTTP client. Minimal, fast, and keyboard-friendly.

### 👍 Features (implemented)
- **GET requests**
  - When sending a request, it's stored along with the response. You can run the same request many times.
- **Keyboard**:
  - Enter: send
  - Escape: go back to the URL bar

### 🗺️ Roadmap
1. Headers and query params in requests  
The CRUD exist, but the UI shows a stub for now.
2. HTTP methods other than GET + request body editing
3. Import/export of data
4. Other protocols and more...

### 💻 Tech stack
- [iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced) for GUI
- [reqwest](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest) for HTTP
- [rusqlite](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite) as the SQLite driver

### ▶️ Getting started
